## Overall Quality Score

The overall quality score is calculated from:
- Narrative Craft Score (weighted average of all craft metrics)
- Originality Score (weighted average of all originality metrics)
- Voice Consistency Score
- Editorial Score (weighted average of all editorial metrics)

**Good Overall Score**: 75-100
**Acceptable Score**: 70-74
**Needs Improvement**: <70 (may trigger regeneration)

## Regeneration Behavior

Chapters are automatically regenerated if:
- Originality score <60
- Narrative Craft score <65
- Voice Consistency score <70
- Generic patterns detected
- Mechanical structures detected
- Derivative content detected

Regeneration attempts up to 3 times with enhanced constraints targeting specific failures.
